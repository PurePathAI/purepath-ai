Background & Context
Urban communities in many developing regions are experiencing increasing challenges in managing solid waste effectively. Rapid population growth, limited waste collection infrastructure, and poor disposal practices have resulted in waste accumulation in streets, open drains, and waterways.
In this environment, waste is often treated purely as “trash” rather than a recoverable resource. As a result, recyclable materials such as plastics, metals, and paper frequently end up in drainage systems and nearby water bodies. This contributes to blocked waterways, flooding, groundwater contamination, and the spread of waterborne diseases.
Currently, there is little real-time visibility for municipal authorities to monitor pollution hotspots or respond quickly. The lack of a direct, technology-driven connection between citizens, waste authorities, and recycling enterprises continues to worsen sanitation outcomes and slows progress toward SDG 6.

Rapid urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has outpaced municipal infrastructure, creating a "perfect storm" for sanitation crises. Unlike high-income nations where waste collection coverage exceeds 96%, many African cities struggle with a massive "collection gap".
The Continental Context: In Sub-Saharan Africa, waste collection averages just 44%, leaving over 62 million tons of waste uncollected annually. In cities like Lagos, Nigeria, it is estimated that nearly 50% of municipal solid waste is dumped directly into canals and lagoons. This is not merely an aesthetic issue; in Kumasi, Ghana, municipal reports indicate that 60% of drainage blockages are caused by plastic refuse. When these "plastic dams" form, upstream water levels can rise by 1 meter per hour during seasonal rains, intensifying floods that have affected over 38 million people across the continent in recent decades.

Problem Statement
Urban municipalities in Africa lack the real-time visibility needed to manage these "black spot" dumps. Residents in high-density, low-income neighborhoods often witness waste accumulation daily, but without a streamlined digital tool, their observations never reach the authorities in an actionable format.
As a result:
Flooding & Health: Blocked drains trigger flash floods and subsequent outbreaks of cholera and typhoid.
Infrastructure Decay: Standing water from clogged drains accelerates the erosion of urban road networks.
Economic Leakage: Potentially recyclable materials estimated to represent an $8 billion annual opportunity for Africa are lost to water bodies instead of entering the circular economy.
Target Audience
The primary users and beneficiaries of this solution include:
Municipal Waste Management Authorities (Admins):
 Require accurate, data-driven insights and location-based waste reports to optimize waste collection and sanitation response.


Urban Residents:
 Need cleaner surroundings, improved sanitation, and opportunities to earn incentives through recyclable waste reporting.


Recycling Companies and Buy-Back Centers (SMEs):
 Seek a reliable supply of sorted recyclable materials to support circular economy operations.


Secondary stakeholders include environmental NGOs and public health agencies concerned with sanitation and clean water outcomes.

Existing Solutions & Gaps
While some cities rely on manual waste collection schedules and general public sanitation campaigns, these approaches remain insufficient. Existing gaps include:
Lack of real-time waste reporting and monitoring tools


Minimal waste sorting at the point of disposal


Weak citizen engagement and incentives for recycling


Poor linkage between waste generators and recycling enterprises


As a result, waste continues to enter waterways before authorities can respond effectively.
The current market is divided into three main categories: general civic reporting, awareness-driven tracking, and internal municipal logistics.
A. Current Market Landscape
Civic Issue Reporting (e.g., SeeClickFix): These platforms allow residents to report non-emergency issues like potholes or "illegal dumping." However, they treat all waste as a generic "issue." A report of a plastic-clogged drain looks the same as a report of a broken streetlight, requiring a human operator to manually sort and prioritize.
Litter Tracking Tools (e.g., Litterati): A powerful tool for "crowdsourced cleaning" and data advocacy. Users photograph individual pieces of litter to identify brands and materials. While excellent for environmental awareness and policy advocacy, it is rarely integrated into a city’s daily operational dispatch or used for high-volume dumping site management.
Municipal GIS Dashboards: Many cities use internal Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map sanitation routes. These systems are often "blind" to real-time events, relying on scheduled pickups rather than reactive data. They lack a user-facing component, meaning they don't capture the "ground truth" observed by residents.

5. Why PurePath AI? (Comparative Analysis)
PurePath AI fills the "Intelligence Gap" by combining the reach of a civic app with the technical depth of an AI classifier and the operational utility of a GIS dashboard.

The Critical Gaps Filled:
Automated Prioritization: Unlike general apps, PurePath AI uses Computer Vision to instantly flag reports containing "Plastic" or "Mixed Waste" in high-flood zones, moving them to the top of the municipal queue without human intervention.
Circular Economy Linkage: By categorizing waste before a crew arrives, PurePath can notify local recycling startups when a "Plastic-heavy" hotspot is identified, allowing them to intercept valuable materials before they reach a landfill.
Proactive Risk Mapping: By analyzing recurring GPS data, the system identifies "Chronic Hotspots"areas where waste consistently returns allowing cities to move from cleaning up messes to implementing preventative infrastructure (e.g., adding permanent bins or cameras).



Proposed Solution: PurePath AI
PurePath AI is a mobile-first waste reporting and recycling ecosystem designed to improve urban sanitation through citizen participation and AI-driven waste classification.
Core components include:
Crowdsourced Reporting Interface:
 Users upload GPS-tagged photos of waste pollution in their environment.


Administrative Dashboard:
 Municipal authorities can identify pollution hotspots and coordinate rapid waste collection.


Circular Economy Marketplace:
 A directory connecting residents with recycling companies and buy-back centers.


Community Forum and Education Hub:
 Encourages awareness, engagement, and sustainable waste disposal habits.


This solution directly supports SDG 6 by preventing waste from contaminating water systems and improving sanitation infrastructure.
 
Solution Context & Use Case
Solution Context & Use Case (Rewritten & Expanded)
PurePath AI is designed for densely populated urban communities where unmanaged waste frequently blocks drainage channels, contaminates nearby water sources, and increases the likelihood of flooding and waterborne disease outbreaks.
The system enables real-time collaboration between residents, municipal waste authorities, and recycling enterprises through AI-powered reporting and geospatial monitoring.

Realistic Urban Deployment Scenario
Consider a municipal division with approximately 50,000 residents,
12 primary drainage channels, and 4 municipal waste collection teams.
Current situation without PurePath AI:
20–30 illegal dumping incidents occur weekly.
Only ~40% of cases are resolved within 72 hours due to delayed reporting.
During heavy rainfall, blocked drains affect 200–500 households, causing localized flooding and sanitation risks.
Municipal authorities rely on manual patrols and public complaints, resulting in limited real-time visibility of pollution hotspots.

Operational Workflow Using PurePath AI
1. Citizen Detection and Reporting
A resident notices plastic and organic waste accumulating inside a roadside drainage channel.
Using the PurePath AI mobile web platform, the resident uploads a GPS-tagged photo, which takes less than 30 seconds.
2. Instant AI Waste Classification and Risk Scoring
The computer vision model analyzes the image and classifies the waste composition:
Plastic – 70%
Organic – 20%
Mixed/Other – 10%
Because the waste is located within 5 meters of a drainage channel, the system assigns a high flood-risk priority score.
3. Real-Time Mapping and Municipal Notification
The report appears immediately on the municipal dashboard map.
If five or more reports occur within a 200-meter radius, PurePath AI automatically flags a pollution hotspot and generates a cleanup task for the nearest collection team.
4. Recycling Coordination and Resource Optimization
Registered recycling SMEs receive alerts about recoverable plastic materials in the hotspot.
Simultaneously, the municipal system suggests an optimized truck route, reducing fuel use and response time.
5. Cleanup, Verification, and Citizen Feedback
Waste collection teams clear the blockage within 24 hours, compared to the previous 72-hour average.
The reporting resident receives a status update and participation incentive points, encouraging continued civic engagement.

AI Integration
What the AI will do: The AI acts as a Digital Sorting Assistant. When a user uploads a picture, the AI classifies the material and provides a "Recycling Manual" (e.g., "This is PET Plastic; wash and take to a collection center" or "This is Organic; suitable for sale to Agri-companies").
Technical Framework
We will use TensorFlow.js to run a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or YOLOv8 model directly in the web browser. This enables real-time waste classification without requiring heavy backend infrastructure, making the system lightweight and accessible.
Dataset
The model is trained on localized waste datasets that capture packaging types, organic waste, and region-specific materials. Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation improve accuracy and robustness across diverse waste categories.
Feasibility
The system is feasible due to:
Accessibility: Running in-browser with TensorFlow.js reduces deployment costs.
Scalability: Transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet) accelerates training.
Community Impact: Provides recycling recommendations tailored to each category, supporting sustainable waste management.

SDG Alignment & Impact
Assigned SDG: SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation
Improper waste disposal directly contributes to blocked drainage systems, polluted waterways, and unsafe sanitation conditions. PurePath AI addresses this by enabling early waste detection, faster response, and improved recycling participation.
Impact Pathway:
Direct impact through reduced water pollution and cleaner drainage systems


Indirect impact through economic empowerment via waste-to-wealth incentives


Expected outcomes include improved environmental hygiene, reduced flooding risk, enhanced recycling supply chains, and healthier urban communities.
Conclusion
PurePath AI proposes a scalable, AI-powered approach to addressing urban waste pollution and sanitation challenges. By combining citizen reporting, waste authority coordination, and intelligent waste classification, the solution provides a practical pathway toward cleaner cities and improved water sanitation.
This project delivers measurable environmental, social, and economic value while supporting progress toward SDG 6 in a sustainable and impactful way.
